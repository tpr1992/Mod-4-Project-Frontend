### NHTSA Search Engine

Please run `npm start` to launch application. For the backend, please run `rails s` on port 3000.

This is my mod 4 project from Flatiron School and is intended to search the database of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for all car makes and models from the past ~50 years.

The frontend is built in React and uses SemanticUI for styling. Conditional rendering is used for live search results as the user types, and loading is controlled via state.

The backend can be found here - https://github.com/tpr1992/Mod-4-Project-Backend
